## Edit, patch, rebase

A few thoughts on edit, patch, rebase cycle.


### Know about git add --patch

You don't have to use it all the time, just know about it.

```
$ git add --patch
```

It allows to interactively select hunks for a commit. Useful to craft
semantically sensible commits, e.g. separate updates to documentation from a
fix, from a feature.

Works in the opposite direction, e.g. `git reset --patch`, too.

Shorthand: `git add -p`, in essence, you can have a mess of changes and your
commits still look fantastic.

### Rebase

Seems to be the most irritating thing. It has two broad use cases:

* reorganize your own work
* allow for a linear project history

#### Reorganize your work

A most basic scenario:

* branch off master (into a feature branch)
* hack on things
* commit, commit, commit - dirty, ugly commits, no messages, uncomprehensible
* it seems to work
* then: **interactively rebase**
* people will think you are a genius, coming up with clean solutions from the start

#### Linear history

By default, each Merge Request is actually a merge.

The Fast-Forward option needs to be explicitly enabled:

* [Enabling fast-forward
  merges](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/fast_forward_merge.html)

> When a fast-forward merge is not possible, the user is given the option to
> rebase.
