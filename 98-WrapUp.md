There was a documentation effort at around git 1.5.0 (2010), since then lots of
documentations, books and more became available, more people used git, github
gets purchased for $7.5 billion, many [alternatives](https://gitea.io),
[emerged](https://gitlab.com), [over](https://sourcehut.org/),
the [past](https://gogs.io/) [years](https://gitolite.com).

```man
$ man giteveryday

    giteveryday - A useful minimum set of commands for Everyday Git

* INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPER (STANDALONE)
* INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPER (PARTICIPANT)
* INTEGRATOR

```
